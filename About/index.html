                                                I got the full game. I didn't get that far in the story. I dropped/stopped playing the
                                                game because the camera controls were horrendous (compunded by MH's generally difficult
                                                gameplay and me trying to use Light Bow Gun, a difficult weapon). Then I looked into
                                                getting the more recent Monster Hunter Games.</li>

                                            <li>I bought the base game on sale this year in April. A few months after I picked the game
                                                up again and my Minecraft friends bought the game and joined me in playing through the rest 
                                                of the story. One of those friends bought me Iceborne (DLC Expansion). We all got burnt
                                                out a few story quests in. but I'm planning on coming back to the game someday!</li>
